# Cloud-Condition-Project

Objective was to build such a Machine Learning model that can predict cloud condition based upon historical data consists of several parameters. The dataset had 71428 rows & 12 columns, here the EDA was easy, but prediction was tough because the dependent variable was multiclass. I built several Machine learning models out of which the gradientboostingclassifier performed better.
